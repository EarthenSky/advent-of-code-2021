# advent-of-code 2021
These are my solutions to the advent-of-code 2021 problems

### Goals:
My goals this year are the following:
- use more than 10 different programming languages
- the total number of lines needed to solve all problems should be less than 3000 -> ~:120 lines per program on average
- all problems must run in less than 45s total -> 1.5s per program on average

### Possible Languages:
Interested
- Koka https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html
- mun
- Eff
- elixir \*\* oh god why did I attempt this 
- crystal
- Nix
- dart
- perl \*\* i dislike syntax, but relatively easy to figure out; https://xkcd.com/519/
- vala https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/vala/ (is pretty much C#)
- nim \*\* syntax is... a bit weird & inconsistent. Definitely *not* minimal however.
- cone
- pen
- V \*\* wow, would be pretty impressive if it wasn't so buggy

Somewhat Interested
- TypeScript
- Ruby
- Go
- Kotlin
- Groovy
- OCaml
- Delphi
- common lisp
- erlang
- julia


### Notes:
- day7 I had to do the problem while tranferring between trains & busses & my phone, so I used python. (My phone has ish which is ~300-70 times slower than wsl, which is why I couldn't feasibly do a fast O(n^2) solution)
